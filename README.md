# COMP562Final

## General Information
* The ideas and the corresponding code are in MLProject.ipynb.
* To see the performance of the models, please take a look at Final.ipynb, which is downloaded from my playground on Google Colab. 
* The dataset I made can be downloaded from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bDVON5qWu1WEby10Xxhp3ykxbYrRp0YB/view?usp=sharing, in which there are 3148 images and the corresponding landmarks.
